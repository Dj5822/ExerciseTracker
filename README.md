# Exercise Tracker

## Introduction
Do you feel depressed while looking at your empty Github activity log?
No worries! Now you can feel even more depressed by looking at your empty exercise log.
It's easy to use. All you have to do is select either 'Push ups' or 'Pull ups', and then
type in the quantity of the exercise you have done. After pressing 'Add', then your good to go.

Once you have enough data, track your progress (or your decline), by going to the 'data' page.

Great! Unfortunately, there aren't many features at the moment, but as soon as I can muster up the energy,
I'll start implemenet some of the more interesting features. For example, I am going to add a radar chart
that displays your physical capabilities in comparison to the average person. That way you can see how
weak or strong you are compared to most the people that are at your age. And of course, it wouldn't be a
'modern day' application without those funky animations and transitions so I'll add that too.
Also, I might as well add in some motivational quotes in the application because it might help the user
grow a couple of inches. And I might as well allow the user to set their profile picture to anime characters
because obviously our target audience are going to be those fat otakus and not those chads that can already pump
out a million push ups. 

## How to use
From the root directory...
Go to the backend folder and run:
`npm install`
